Make any changes you want.
The head of your model should be separate from the rest of the body. You can use the bisect tool in edit mode to separate the head if it isn’t already.
Make sure the body and head of your model match the names of the pilot model.
Drag your model’s head and body into the correct collection.
Delete the pilot models head and body after doing so.
Renaming and putting your model in the correct collection.
Rig the model to match the bones of the armature that came with the pilot model.
Create an armature modifier for your model's body and head.

Attach the model’s body and head to the armature.
Make sure your model is aligned with the armature before attaching the model to it.

A properly rigged model should look like this.

If you have multiple textures on your model then you would create several materials that match the name of the textures for the pilot you are modifying.
If you only have one texture for your model just create one material for your entire model.
Use LegionPlus to view paths for materials.
